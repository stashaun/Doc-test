The disk layout defines how the data is stored on the physical disk devices. When a new node is created, the default disk layout is assigned to the new node if the user does not specify a node-specific disk layout.

Tip: When installing disk devices, it is recommended to combine two physical disks in RAID 1 to prevent data loss.
Disk Layout
When a node is created, it is assigned either the default disk layout, or the user specifies a node-specific disk layout. For a data node, the following four partitions are required:
OS partition (e.g. 'd00_os')
EXACluster OS is installed on this partition. It is an ext4 filesystem with journaling, and is AES 256 encrypted. It should be assigned at least 50 GiB of space.
Swap partition (e.g. 'd01_swap')
Used for swap data. It should be assigned at least 4 GiB of space.
Data partition (e.g. 'd02_data')
Used for database logs and coredumps. It is an ext4 filesystem with journaling. It should be assigned at least 50 GiB of space.
EXAStorage partition (e.g. 'd03_storage')
Used for persistent and temporary database data. It runs on one or more physical disks.
For a physical cluster, how you set up your disk layout depends on the hardware setup you have selected - a RAID Mirror with a Software RAID, or a hardrive with a dedicated OS disk.
