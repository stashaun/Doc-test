# EXAoperation XMLRPC API

###### Please note that this is an open source project which is *not officially supported* by EXASOL. We will try to help you as much as possible, but can't guarantee anything since this is not an official EXASOL product.


This project contains Python script examples how to automate the administration of EXASOL cluster using its XMLRPC API instead of EXAoperation's web interface. Additionally, you'll find a complete description for all API methods in file [EXAoperation_XMLRPC.md](EXAoperation_XMLRPC.md).

## Import

```python
>>> from xmlrpclib import Server as xmlrpc
```

## Create connection

For the connection type full URL to the exaoperation.

```python
>>> server = xmlrpc('http://admin:admin@10.10.1.1/cluster1')
```

## Methods and objects

To list the methods and objects, use the `listMethods` and `listObjects` functions.
```python
>>> server.listMethods()
['activateNodes', 'addBackupService', 'addBucketFS', 'addDatabase', ....]
>>> server.listObjects()
['bfsdefault', 'logservice1', 'n0011', 'n0012', 'n0013', 'n0014', 'storage', 'support']
```

EXAoperation XMLRPC has tab completion support for python, f.e. in IPython notebook:
```python
In [1]: server.add<TAB>
   server.addBackupService   server.addKeyStore        server.addPublicNetwork   server.addSrvMgmtGroup
   server.addBucketFS        server.addLogService      server.addRemoteVolume    server.addUser
   server.addDatabase        server.addNode            server.addRoute           server.addVLAN
   server.addJDBCDriver      server.addNodesFromXML    server.addScriptExtension
```

## Method description

To get the method description, please use the `methodHelp` function.
```python
>>> server.storage.methodHelp('startEXAStorage')
>>> print server.storage.methodHelp('startEXAStorage')
Start EXAStorage service.
    Tries to start EXAStorage. Raises UsageError in case of error.

Usage: storage.startEXAStorage(ignored_nodes)
Parameters:
  ignored_nodes - list of nodes, where EXAStorage will not be started, or an empty list.
```

## Start and configure storage

Start storage with `startEXAStorage` function.

```python
>>> server.storage.startEXAStorage()
'OK'
```

To create a volume, use the `addStorageVolume` function.
```python
>>> server.storage.addStorageVolume({'allowed_users': ['admin'],
                                     'hdd_type': 'd03_storage',
                                     'masternodes': 4,
                                     'nodes_list': ['n0011', 'n0012', 'n0013', 'n0014'],
                                     'redundancy': 1,
                                     'size': 8,
                                     'volume_type': 'Data'})
'v0000'
```

The `hdd_type` and `nodes_list` values can be discovered with `getListValues` function:
```python
>>> print server.storage.getListValues('StorageDisks')
['d03_storage']
>>> print server.storage.getListValues('Nodes')
['n0014', 'n0011', 'n0012', 'n0013']
```

The list of users is available with `getAllUserLogins` function:
```python
>>> server.getAllUserLogins()
['admin']
```

## Create, configure and start the database

Creation of the database is very similar to the creation of the storage volume:
```python
>>> server.addDatabase({'clients_port_number': 2568,
                        'data_disk': 'd02_data',
                        'database_name': 'db1',
                        'database_version': '6.0.dev5',
                        'memory_usage': 4,
                        'nodes_list': ['n0011', 'n0012', 'n0013', 'n0014'],
                        'nodes_number': 4})
'db_db1'
```

Then the database itself can be created and started:
```python
>>> server.db_db1.createDatabase()
>>> server.db_db1.startDatabase()
>>> server.db_db1.getDatabaseInfo()
{'connectible': 'No',
 'connection string': '10.50.1.11..14:2568',
 'info': '',
 'name': 'db1',
 'nodes': {'active': ['n0011', 'n0012', 'n0013', 'n0014'],
  'failed': [],
  'reserve': []},
 'operation': 'None',
 'persistent volume': 'v0000',
 'quota': 0,
 'state': 'setup',
 'temporary volume': 'None',
 'usage persistent': 0,
 'usage temporary': 0}
```

After some time the `connectible` is set to 'Yes' and the database can be used.
